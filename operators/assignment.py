#Demonstrates the usage of assignment operators in python.

# the = assignment operator is one of the most used operator and is used to assign value on RHS to variable on LHS
x = 10
y = 3
a = "Hey There!"

#The assignment operator is used in conjunction with most of the arithmetic, relational operators
#The Assignment compound operator used with arithmetic operator.

print("Adding a value of y to x using x += y", x += y) # x = x + y
print("Subtracting a value of y from x and using x -= y", x -= y)
print("Multiplying a value of y to x using x *= y", x *= y)
print("Dividing x with y using x /= y", x /= y)
print("Dividing x with y using x = x%y", x %= y)
print("exponential value of x = x**y ", x **= y)
print("Floor Division x with y using x //= y", x //= y)
