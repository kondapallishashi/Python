#Python handles multiple statement blocks which for a single block of code as suites.
#complex or compound statements such as if, while, def, class etc require a header and a suite.
#header lines begin the statement with a keyword, terminate with a colon (:), followed by multiple lines of code which form the suite.

# if expression:

# else : 
#   suite

#if expression:
